# Word-Puzzle-Game-in-C
This was an assignment given to me in the university to create a word puzzle game in C programming language 
In this final task 8, a grid is created as per the size given by the user
The grid is filled randomly and the words are added into the puzzle at random locations
The words can be computer based or user can choose to store words according to his choice in the puzzle and then finally try to find the words he/she has added
